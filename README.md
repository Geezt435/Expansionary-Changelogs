#### (1.2.1)

**Major Update**

**New Units, Features, Abilities, and Additions!**

- New Units: *Chompion*.
- Reworked Units: *Ghoul, Totem, Thronekeeper, Druid, Soulsforge Swordcaster, Ancestral Conquerer, Earl, Glacier Giant, Excalibur, Cyber Punk, Dubcore Artillery, Ionic Tyrant, Wayang, Helldraw*, and many others!
- *Rogue* now has a one-time unique ability called **Betrayal**, which when he is under **30** health, he transforms into a team unit with **1** health point, yet aims at allied enemies, but there are many drawbacks! He automatically loses if he's alone, he will be also aimed at by his old teammates due to him practically switching sides, and if there are 2 undercovers *Rogue*, when they met each other closely they will try to kill each other.  
- Updated *Guardian*'s shield to have a **50%** chance to absorb projectiles, destroying them completely or deflecting them with very low velocity.
- *Ancestral Conquerer* now has a passive ability called **Between Heaven and Hell**, which makes him able to fly upward upon reaching a low level.
- *Unnamed Peasant* now has an ability called **Void of Soul**, which acts like a black hole, which sucks on every unit near him, also added a new ability called **Reaching Fragment**, where *Unnamed Peasant* condensed his essences into multiple homing strikes that can hit once, damage based on how long it is active, the more it is alive the more it damages, upon reaching 0 damage, it dies off.
- *Behemoth* now has a new passive ability called **Lame de Flamme**, which sets every enemy near him on extreme fire.
- Replaced *Wayang* explosion on hit with a new ability called **Divine Sunshine**, which is the best way to deal with low-health armies since it makes every enemy within a few radius burst a mini-sun, but there's a drawback, the sun deals damage to allies and enemies. The ability activates when it swings its sword, and it takes a few seconds to reload.
- *Bounty Hunter* now has an ability called **Dead Line**, which increased damage by **1%** each time it travels, it has a max capped of **5000** damage.
- *Helldraw* now has custom bases and a custom ability to absorb any projectiles to heal herself and increase health by **66%** of the damage of light projectiles and bounce back the projectile with increased damage and force by **150%**, this ability would be capped when Helldraw reached 500 or more health. This however also has a lethal drawback, of turning enemies projectile that is absorbed to be more fatal!
- Added custom trail design for *Cyber punk* swing.
- Added **Bloated Blood** ability for *Bloodwalker*, which lets him regenerate by **25%** of lost health in **15** seconds, meaning the more he lost health, the higher the heals.
- Added hidden easter eggs for a *Puppeteer* that has a chance of **1%** to appear.
- added an ability called **Void of Soul** to *Unnamed Peasant*, which acts like a black hole.
- *Earl*'s flail now causes a small miner explosion and added a custom ability for him that matches with his 1st ability called **Axe Trio**, giving him more offense ability when he is surrounded.

- *Brewer* Rainbow is now brighter than before, as well her potion's explosion now won't damage her or her teammates.

🎉 ***10th Update Milestone!*** 🎉

**AY, IT'S THE EXPANSIONARY 10TH UPDATE, THANK YOU ALL FOR PLAYING MY SMALL MOD AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED ME IMPLEMENT THE MOD!**

- Introducing a new Faction called **Experiment**! For now, it has 5 units(*Clint Eastwood, Soulsforge Swordcaster, King Midas, Siren, and Sentinel*), this faction is going to be all the ideas that don't seem to fit in any current theme but interesting units.
- Added a secret unit to the secret faction.
- More custom icons! This time, Eastwood is by me :)
- Removed the Candlepush effect from Druid's attack, but increased the projectiles spawned from 3 to 6 on each hand, and added a spread value of 1.5.
- *Bug Fanatic* Improvement: Fixed *Bug*'s wings color is Valkyrie color instead of Jungle Themed, Bugs also died on 100 seconds now instead of 5 seconds, but now the bug is spawned per original times 1.5 cooldown.
- *Voidmaster* appearances and weapons are changed.
- The cost of *Voidmaster* from 100000 turned to 40000.

#### (1.0.9)

- A fix of nerfing and buff to some units that is too much on the previous update. (*Behemoth*, *Ghoul*, *Forest Archer*, *Soul Tyrant*, *Rogue*, and *Templar*)
- Phantoms / Ghost unit which is *Behemoth, *Druid* can pass through light projectiles, while Dread-like *Voidmaster* can pass through anything(heavy projectiles and arrow, light projectiles, also can clip into the wall as long as the sword doesn't hold him back, and can go into the ground and resurface back with charge attack)! **Please mind that unit Headless Horseman and unit Headless Rider will not have the ability to pass through light projectiles even though they are specter because of balance reasons, they are already fast enough against the ranged unit.**

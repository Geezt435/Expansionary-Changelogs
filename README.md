## Changelogs 🎁 

#### (1.2.1)

**Major Update**

**New Units, Features, Abilities, and Additions!**

- New Units: *Chompion*.
- Reworked Units: *Ghoul, Totem, Thronekeeper, Druid, Soulsforge Swordcaster, Ancestral Conquerer, Earl, Glacier Giant, Excalibur, Cyber Punk, Dubcore Artillery, Ionic Tyrant, Wayang, Helldraw*, and many others!
- *Rogue* now has a one-time unique ability called **Betrayal**, which when he is under **30** health, he transforms into a team unit with **1** health point, yet aims at allied enemies, but there are many drawbacks! He automatically loses if he's alone, he will be also aimed at by his old teammates due to him practically switching sides, and if there are 2 undercovers *Rogue*, when they met each other closely they will try to kill each other.  
- Updated *Guardian*'s shield to have a **50%** chance to absorb projectiles, destroying them completely or deflecting them with very low velocity.
- *Ancestral Conquerer* now has a passive ability called **Between Heaven and Hell**, which makes him able to fly upward upon reaching a low level.
- *Unnamed Peasant* now has an ability called **Void of Soul**, which acts like a black hole, which sucks on every unit near him, also added a new ability called **Reaching Fragment**, where *Unnamed Peasant* condensed his essences into multiple homing strikes that can hit once, damage based on how long it is active, the more it is alive the more it damages, upon reaching 0 damage, it dies off.
- *Behemoth* now has a new passive ability called **Lame de Flamme**, which sets every enemy near him on extreme fire.
- Replaced *Wayang* explosion on hit with a new ability called **Divine Sunshine**, which is the best way to deal with low-health armies since it makes every enemy within a few radius burst a mini-sun, but there's a drawback, the sun deals damage to allies and enemies. The ability activates when it swings its sword, and it takes a few seconds to reload.
- *Bounty Hunter* now has an ability called **Dead Line**, which increased damage by **1%** each time it travels, it has a max capped of **5000** damage.
- *Helldraw* now has custom bases and a custom ability to absorb any projectiles to heal herself and increase health by **66%** of the damage of light projectiles and bounce back the projectile with increased damage and force by **150%**, this ability would be capped when Helldraw reached 500 or more health. This however also has a lethal drawback, of turning enemies projectile that is absorbed to be more fatal!
- Added custom trail design for *Cyber punk* swing.
- Added **Bloated Blood** ability for *Bloodwalker*, which lets him regenerate by **25%** of lost health in **15** seconds, meaning the more he lost health, the higher the heals.
- Added hidden easter eggs for a *Puppeteer* that has a chance of **1%** to appear.
- added an ability called **Void of Soul** to *Unnamed Peasant*, which acts like a black hole.
- *Earl*'s flail now causes a small miner explosion and added a custom ability for him that matches with his 1st ability called **Axe Trio**, giving him more offense ability when he is surrounded.

**Revamp and Bug Fixes!**

- *Brewer* Rainbow is now brighter than before, as well her potion's explosion now won't damage her or her teammates.

- Decreased health generation from *Ancestral Conquerer* by **70%**, but increased his health to 4000 and cost to 10000, and fixed the bug where it bypasses health value.
- Added knockback to *Ancestral Conquerer*'s explosions to indicate damages, and big explosion on the giant one, also improved his wings function so that it flies high when enemies are far and kind of hovers over when enemies are close. 
- *Ghoul*'s tree visual was assigned to be smaller.
- Reduced the cost of *Gravedigger* by a little.
- Changed *Glacier Giant*'s Tornado rotation to be slower so it doesn't look too nauseating.
- *Druid*'s acidic explosion now has small damage and nerfed implosion force, as well as improved visual to be less annoying.

- Improved *Earl* to be more menacing in size.
- *Rogue* health has been increased by **8%**.

- All Sub units that fit no criteria are now in the **Subunits** faction instead of having no faction, and all **Sub units** have a logo of custom Expansionary logo.
- *Eastwood* now could dodge projectiles and melee normally, and also fixed lags due to particle overlaps in the **Speed Riggy** ability.
- *Gravedigger*, now reset health when switching to **Bat** state and **Vampire** state, but only himself and not his armies.
